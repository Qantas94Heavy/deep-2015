splashed in a small pond
with birds had a bond
kept dyeing the hair blonde
would wake up and yawn
did not go beyond
would never respond
with friends would correspond
rolled down a quaint hill
looked for a bank bill
wished there was a chill
played with dentist’s drill
was dressed all in frills
felt ever so ill
looked inside a will
kept driving downhill
would weep a boohoo
had no other clue
was sick with the flu
had a beansprout that grew
made sure that they knew
wore shoes that were new
updated a queue
in a room with a view
fed a kangaroo
worried what to bring 
couldn’t really cling
wished to kill the king
tried to buy a ring
never tried to sing
got the coil spring
suffered a bee sting
at gaming would slay
with Febreze would spray
did not want to stay
wanted their own way
learned to do ballet
would never betray
ate at a buffet
worked at a café
seemed bound to decay
was always delayed
worked on an essay
wished to run away away
went to get x rays
whistled all day long
tried to not sound wrong
loved to wear thongs
would sing a sweet song
was humming along
with work would prolong
loved to snap their chalks
wished he/she/it flew like hawks
went out with a jock
at strangers would mock
to other would shock
was too shy to talk
across water could walk
flew to see Iraq
cried at 8 o’clock
tried to become a clown
wanted to steal the crown
in water would drown
ommitted all nouns
towards children would frown
could make it around
never looked down
ate grapes by the beck
just wanted the cheque
with homework would check
fished up on the deck
wore jewels round their neck
just waited a sec
on textbooks had drawn
hoped she hadn’t gone
stayed awake ‘till dawn
ate their mash with prawns
stopped short at a swan
dreamed to be a bee
was stuck with a flee
wished to just break free
wanted to be like me
looked for a missed key
loved to eat green pea
swam deep in the sea
climbed up a tall tree
sipped on some hot tea
just got a degree
wished to catch a flea
wished a guarantee
tried to win a bid
said not what they did
mapped life on grid
in bushes had hid
was just a rude kid
lost all their lids
in cars would skid
had an inky squid
got bit by a crow
loved makin’ the dough
found a diamond that glow
just had to know
reached an all time low
was fond of eating roe
would run very slow
ran through the wood
hopped on a boat
took a balloon
built a cocoon 
sat on the couch
took a long walk
put on a frock
cooked up a storm
did a small jig
played at a gig
ran up the stairs
bought a pet mouse
then soon understood
married a kind goat
flew up to the moon
escaped a monsoon
ate chips from a pouch
left without a sock
made it to the block
ate ‘till it turned warm
put on a pink wig
took one more swift swig
found something to wear
bought a brand new house
listened to some Strauss
